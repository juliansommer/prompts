  - add a search bar where user can input theirs and it matches against a list of most common models
    - if doesnt work, just have it be a custom model

- add a way for users to easily test others prompts

  - if the model is gpt-3.5, can click a button to test prompt
    - then user inputs their query and show the ai response

- when user is inputting their prompt

  - if the text contains "please"
    - have a popup with a link to the study about why its not a good idea

- migrate to typescript
